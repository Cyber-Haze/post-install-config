<h1>osTicket - Post-Install Configuration</h1>
This tutorial provides a detailed overview of the post-installation configuration process for the open-source help desk ticketing system, osTicket. In this phase, we will take the system from its initial setup to a fully operational help desk system, ready for handling real-world support tickets..<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Cloud Compute, used to host the osTicket installation)
- Remote Desktop: Secure access to the virtual machine hosting osTicket for configuration and management purposes.
- Internet Information Services (IIS) Web server software that hosts the osTicket web application on Windows.

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Post-Install Configuration Objectives</h2>

In this step, we will configure important components within osTicket to ensure it functions effectively. These components include:
</br>

- Roles: Assign roles to different agents, such as Admins and Support Staff, to manage access and permissions.
- SLAs (Service Level Agreements): Configure SLAs to ensure timely ticket resolutions based on severity.
- Departments: Create various departments (e.g., IT, Customer Support) to handle tickets based on the type of request.
- Teams: Configure teams that handle specific types of support, such as Level I or Level II support.
- Agents (Workers): Add agents who will manage and resolve tickets.
- Users (Customers): Add the users who will submit tickets to the help desk.
- Help Desk Topics: Define help topics to categorize tickets based on the issues users may encounter.

<h2>Configure SLA</h2>
<h3> Service Level Agreements </h3>
<br />

<p> An SLA defines the agreed service standards between a provider and client. It sets clear expectations, outlines performance targets (e.g., uptime, response time), ensures accountability, builds trust, and provides a basis for conflict resolution if targets arenâ€™t met.</p>
<br />
