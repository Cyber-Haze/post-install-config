<h1>osTicket - Post-Install Configuration</h1>
This tutorial provides a detailed overview of the post-installation configuration process for the open-source help desk ticketing system, osTicket. In this phase, we will take the system from its initial setup to a fully operational help desk system, ready for handling real-world support tickets..<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Cloud Compute)
- Remote Desktop: Secure access to the virtual machine hosting osTicket for configuration and management purposes.
- Internet Information Services (IIS) Web server software that hosts the osTicket web application on Windows.

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Post-Install Configuration Objectives</h2>

In this step, we will configure important components within osTicket to ensure it functions effectively. These components include:
</br>

- Roles: Assign roles to different agents, such as Admins and Support Staff, to manage access and permissions.
- SLAs (Service Level Agreements): Configure SLAs to ensure timely ticket resolutions based on severity.
- Departments: Create various departments (e.g., IT, Customer Support) to handle tickets based on the type of request.
- Teams: Configure teams that handle specific types of support, such as Level I or Level II support.
- Agents (Workers): Add agents who will manage and resolve tickets.
- Users (Customers): Add the users who will submit tickets to the help desk.
- Help Desk Topics: Define help topics to categorize tickets based on the issues users may encounter.


<h2>Configure Roles</h2>

<img width="959" height="387" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-03 230208" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/569833d6-e22b-478a-9682-cd7369165caf" />

</p>
<p>
  
This area of osTicket contains different levels of access we can create & configure for each individuals and groups/departments.

To Create  
- Navigate to: Admin Panel -> Agents -> Roles
- Create a new "Supreme Admin" role
- Assign full administrative control permission.

</p>
<br />

<h2>Configure SLA</h2>
<h3> Service Level Agreements </h3>
<br />

<p> An SLA defines the agreed service standards between a provider and client. It sets clear expectations, outlines performance targets (e.g., uptime, response time), ensures accountability, builds trust, and provides a basis for conflict resolution if targets arenâ€™t met.</p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="961" height="298" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-03 233143" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/360f3b98-3a1b-4071-bf1d-85fce7706479" />
<img width="960" height="382" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-03 234610" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88c17632-421b-4f41-841c-48a57236113f" />

</p>
<p>
  
For this showcase we will create the following SLA's
  
Admin Panel -> Manage -> SLA
- Sev-A (Grace Period: 1 hour, Schedule: 24/7) coverage for critical system issues.
- Sev-B (Grace Period: 4 hours, Schedule: 24/7) overage for high-priority issues e.g. software failures.
- Sev-C (Grace Period: 8 hours, Business Hours) business hours coverage for less critical issues, e.g password resets.

</p>

</p>
<br />

<h2>Configure Help Topic</h2>
<h3> Help topics categorize the types of support requests users may submit. Proper categorization helps route tickets to the correct team or department which in turn helps with assigning SLA's
</h3>
<br />

<p> 

- Navigate to: Admin Panel -> Manage -> Help Topics
- Add common help topics such as:
  - Business Critical Outage
  - Personal Computer Issues
  - Equipment Request
  - Password Reset

Here we can taylor the help topic to match is severity by assigning priority levels, SLA's, Teams, and departments

</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>

We successfully transformed the osTicket system from its initial installation to a fully operational help desk capable of managing real-world support tickets. By configuring key components such as roles, departments, teams, agents, users, and SLA's we ensured that the system is well-structured for efficient ticket management. Setting up Service Level Agreements (SLAs) allowed us to prioritize and resolve issues within appropriate timeframes based on their severity, while help topics ensured proper categorization and routing of tickets to the correct departments.

This allows for improved operational efficiency and also enhances customer satisfaction through timely and effective issue resolution.
